 * Classify a C-Bus group by the unit that drives it (issues #38, #37).
 *
 * C-Gate's TREEXML reports a <Type> per unit, so a group's entity type can come
 * from the hardware rather than from guessing at its name. A dimmer channel is a
 * dimmable light, a relay channel is an on/off light, and a group driven only by
 * an input unit (bus coupler, key input, sensor) is a binary sensor.
 *
 * Unknown types return null and fall through to existing behaviour. The catalogue
 * of real type strings is incomplete, so guessing would misclassify hardware
 * nobody here has seen; the caller logs unrecognised types instead.

/**
 * Resolve the entity type for a group from the unit types driving it.
 *
 * Dimmer beats relay, so a group driven by both keeps its brightness slider
 * rather than silently losing it. Both conclusions are drawn even alongside
 * an unrecognised type: a recognised dimmer or relay positively proves an
 * output exists, and the fallback for an unclassified Lighting group is
 * already a dimmable light, so suppressing either conclusion here would gain
 * nothing while gutting the most common real topology — a load unit plus an
 * unrecognised wall-switch or key-input unit bound to the same group.
 *
 * binary_sensor is different: it is destructive downstream (the caller
 * publishes a read-only entity and clears the group's retained light config),
 * so it is only returned when every driving type is recognised. An
 * unrecognised type alongside an input suppresses it, because that
 * unrecognised type might itself be a real output this module doesn't know
 * about yet, and wrongly concluding binary_sensor would strip the group of
 * its command topic. A blank type — a unit whose TREEXML <Type> was empty or
 * absent — counts as unrecognised for exactly the same reason: it is a unit
 * driving the group whose capability we cannot establish, and a driving unit
 * is far more likely to be a load than not. 'management' types (PC_, PCLOCAL,
 * TEXT) are known-not-output, so they never count as unrecognised and never
 * block this conclusion.
 *
 * opts.treeIncomplete suppresses binary_sensor outright. A tree whose units
 * have not all synced their <Groups> yet can show an input unit's binding
 * before the load unit's, which looks input-only through no fault of the
 * hardware. Discovery runs before the caller's unsynced-units check, so this
 * is reachable in normal operation, and the cost of being wrong is a retracted
 * light config on a real load.
