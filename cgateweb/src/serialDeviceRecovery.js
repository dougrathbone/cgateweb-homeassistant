 * Recover from a USB PC Interface that renumbered while the add-on was running
 * (issue #28).
 *
 * A replugged PCI can come back on a different ttyUSBn. C-Gate keeps holding the
 * port it opened, the network sits at InterfaceState=closed, and until now only
 * an add-on restart fixed it. NetworkInterfaceMonitor already polls each
 * network's interface state, so recovery hangs off that - off every offline
 * reading, not just the transition, because the transition happens while the
 * PCI is still out and the replug that follows changes nothing the monitor can
 * report.
 *
 * Two signals distinguish a renumber from a genuine fault:
 *   - the device path C-Gate was pointed at has vanished (a raw /dev/ttyUSBn
 *     configuration), or
 *   - that path still exists but now resolves to a different port (a
 *     /dev/serial/by-id configuration, where udev recreates the same link name
 *     over the new tty).
 * A CNI dropout does neither — and a CNI install has no cgate_serial_device at
 * all, so recovery is inert for it.
 *
 * The work itself is a rootfs script (cgateweb-recover-serial): re-resolve the
 * device by its remembered identity, repoint every project database at the new
 * port, then signal C-Gate so s6 restarts it. All three steps are needed;
 * restarting the service does not re-run cont-init, so a project left naming the
 * old port would reopen straight onto a closed interface.
